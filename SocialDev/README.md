# Socialdev.io
Socialdev.io is a mock implementation of a social network such as facebook/twitter/instagram but for code developers.
The backend is built using microservices architecture such that every service doesnt affects the rest of the API and has 0 knowladge or ties to the other services and runs completly on its own accord.
